Feedfinder2
===========

This is a Python library for finding links feeds on a website. It is based on
`feedfinder <http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/feedfinder/>`_ — originally
written by `Mark
Pilgrim <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pilgrim_(software_developer)>`_ and
subsequently maintained by `Aaron
Swartz <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz>`_ until his untimely death.

Usage
-----

Feedfinder2 offers a single public function: ``find_feeds``. You would use it
as follows:

::

    from txfeedfinder2 import find_feeds
    feeds = yield find_feeds("xkcd.com")

Now, ``feeds`` is the list: ``['http://xkcd.com/atom.xml',
'http://xkcd.com/rss.xml']``. There is some attempt made to rank feeds from
best candidate to worst but… well… you never know.
